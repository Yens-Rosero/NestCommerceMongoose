## 📖 **Project Description**

This NestJS application is designed to offer:

- 📦 **Efficient modularization** for scalable architecture.
- 🔗 **MongoDB connection** using Mongoose as ORM.
- **One-to-one and one-to-many entity relationships**.
- Concrete examples of connecting and configuring services using **UseFactory**.
- Implementation of single responsibility and clean architecture best practices in NestJS.

## 🔍 **Main Features**

### **Mongoose Usage**  
- Connect your project to MongoDB quickly and efficiently.  
- Implement relationships:  
  - **One-to-one relationship** (e.g., User ↔ Profile).  
  - **One-to-many relationship** (e.g., Categories ↔ Products).  

### **Modularization**  
- The modularized structure allows adding and scaling functionalities without losing project organization.

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
- Each file and class follows the single responsibility principle, facilitating maintenance and future updates.
